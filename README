WHAT INFOSEC CLOUD APP DOES

InfoSec Cloud app for Splunk is your starter cloud security pack for Splunk. InfoSec Cloud app is designed to address the most common security use cases, including continuous monitoring and security investigations. InfoSec Cloud app also includes a number of advanced threat detection use cases. All of the components of InfoSec Cloud app can be easily expanded using free security resources available for Splunk like Security Essentials app for Splunk: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3435


ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL DETAILS SO YOU KNOW HOW THE APP WORK

InfoSec Cloud app is designed to use only basic Splunk functionality so it is easier for you to make the app your own by modifying and adding content from other free Splunk resources like Splunk Security Essentials (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3435/)

InfoSec Cloud app uses the following macros you can modify to better match your Splunk configuration:
- Splunk indexes with security data `infosec-cloud-indexes`. Default value: index="*"

InfoSec app uses KV Store lookups for user and host information. Lookups are infosec_users and infosec_hosts. You will need to populate the lookups with your user and host information. Investigation dashboards will show user and host information if it is available in the lookups.
